# Router
The goal of the assignment was to determine the paths to connect all of the cities on a map while minimizing the elevation between cities using Dijkstra's. We were given the number of cities and the width of the map as the first line of input. The next lines of input were the coordinates of each of those cities. After those lines, we were given a map of elevations, like so:

*This assignment was co-authored by my partner, Navjot Singh. Sean Davis, my instructor for my Data Structures & Algorithms class, wrote everything except router.\**
